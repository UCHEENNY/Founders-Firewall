# üîê Founders Firewalls

## üß† About  
**Founders Firewalls** is my personal journey from entrepreneurship to cybersecurity.  
This repo documents my learning, hands-on projects, tools, and notes as I build skills in **network security**, **ethical hacking**, and **threat detection**.

## üöÄ Goals  
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Complete industry certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CEH)  
- Tackle real-world labs and security challenges  
- Share my transition to help others making a similar pivot

- # üß™ Lab: DHCP, DNS & Firewall Configuration in a Simulated Network

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview  
This lab was designed to reinforce fundamental networking concepts by building a simple-to-moderate complexity network from scratch using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The focus was on:
- Automating IP address assignment via **DHCP**
- Enabling name resolution with a **DNS server**
- Creating firewall rules to control traffic (e.g., blocking ICMP/ping)

## üß† Objectives  
- Design and implement a functioning local network  
- Set up and configure a **DHCP server** to dynamically assign IPs  
- Deploy a **DNS server** for hostname resolution  
- Apply basic **firewall rules**, including blocking ICMP  
- Validate end-to-end communication and troubleshoot connectivity issues

## üèóÔ∏è Network Topology  
> Designed and built manually in Cisco Packet Tracer

**Devices Used:**
- 1 DHCP/DNS Server
- Multiple end-user PCs
- 1 Firewall Router or Layer 3 Switch
- 1 or more standard switches
- Ethernet cabling throughout

## üîß Configuration Steps

### 1. **Network Design**
- Built the network manually using Packet Tracer tools
- Assigned logical segments (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

### 2. **DHCP Configuration**
- Enabled DHCP on the server
- Defined IP pools (IP range, default gateway, DNS)
- Verified that all client PCs received IPs automatically

### 3. **DNS Configuration**
- Set up DNS service on the same server
- Mapped hostnames to local IP addresses
- Verified name resolution using `ping hostname`

### 4. **Firewall Rules**
- Implemented basic firewall or ACL rules on the router/firewall
- **Blocked ICMP traffic** (prevented ping between devices)
- Allowed HTTP/HTTPS and DNS where needed

| Test                      | Result       |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| PCs received IP via DHCP  | ‚úÖ Success   |
| Hostname resolution works | ‚úÖ Success   |
| ICMP blocked              | ‚úÖ Success   |
| General connectivity      | ‚úÖ Verified  |

Used Packet Tracer's simulation mode and command line (`ping`, `ipconfig`, etc.) to confirm behavior.

## üß© Key Learnings

- How DHCP automates IP distribution across a LAN  
- DNS is essential for human-readable communication  
- Firewalls/ACLs can effectively manage traffic types (like blocking pings)  
- Simulation environments are ideal for prototyping real-world network scenarios
